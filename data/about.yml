title   : What is the Open Research Network?
description: >
  The Brisbane Open Research Network is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers in Brisbane, Australia. It aims to facilitate the growth of open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources. 
  </br></br>
  We are part of a larger network, called the Australia and New Zealand Open Research Network (ANZORN). Together, we aim to ensure that nobody in ANZ needs to pursue open research alone.
  </br></br>
  Not sure if you're an open researcher? That's okay! We welcome people at any level of interest in open research, even people who have never even heard of it. You're welcome to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/BrisOpenRes">Twitter</a>, swing by the ANZORN Slack workspace (you'll have to DM our Twitter for the link, since we're trying to avoid bots â€” and then add yourself to the Brisbane channel when you arrive) or head to the other communities in our network.

  BORN is inspired by the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">Open Science Community Utrecht</a>.
