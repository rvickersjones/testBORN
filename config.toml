If you're not in Brisbane but like the sound of the community, check out the other communities in our network below. </br></br>We aim to help you find like-minded folks, support efforts to reform institutional policies and practices, and educate others about open research.</br></br>BORN is an inclusive and welcoming community by design â€” to preserve this, BORN activities are subject to our <a href='/coc' target='_blank'>Code of Conduct</a>."
